Do Postag n-grams (bigram?) - METU treebank?

TextRank
1- Construct-graph ???
2- creates edges co-occur window of words N ?
3- Set score to 1 for each vertex
4- run ranking algorithm until converge (in paper 20-30 iterations to threshold 0.0001)
5- sort vertices in reverse order with final scores, grab top T( between 5-20). In the article T = sizeOf(document)/3
We can come up with a smarted solution.

Post-Proccessing

1-Collepse adjacent keywords into multi-word keyword
2- Might consider trimming the tree(in our case document is much larger)
3- Visualize
